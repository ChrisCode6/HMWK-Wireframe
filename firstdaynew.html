	My name is Christopher Choi, I am 22 years old, and I am currently a student at Washburn University. I live in Overland Park, Kansas and graduated from Blue Valley North High School in 2014. I am a Junior and apart of Sigma Phi Epsilon Kansas Delta Chapter. I am new to coding and find it challenging, yet exciting and am always looking to learn more. I was always interested in coding and know that it is a field that is always advancing. Knowing code is also becoming an essential skill to have in society, which is why I pursued an internship over the Summer at KUMED's Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth. While working there I was able to receive intro learning to code with HTML and basic beginner CSS. After my internship ended I wished to know more and further my knowledge in coding, thus hearing about the KU Coding Boot Camp from my supervisor and enrolling. Now that I am in the Boot Camp I have already learned enormous amounts of information and am excited for my future in coding, and hopefully one day a career in the field!
